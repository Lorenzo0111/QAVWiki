# ResourcePack

QualityArmoryVehicles uses a resourcepack to create realistic vehicles without replacing existing minecraft items.

Every user of the server should install the resourcepack to see them.

### Automatic installation

With the automatic installation, the resourcepack is downloaded and enabled by default on player join.

### Manual installation

If you set the QAMini.sendResourcepackOnJoin option to `false`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will only work if QualityArmory is not installed.

If it is installed the resourepack will be handled from that plugin.
{% endhint %}
